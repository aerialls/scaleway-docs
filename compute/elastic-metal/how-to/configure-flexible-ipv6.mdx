## How to configure IPv6 on Debian

1. Open the network configuration file `/etc/network/interfaces` in a text editor and edit it as follows:

    ```
    auto eno1
    iface eno1 inet6 static
        address IPV6ADDRESS
        netmask 64
    ```

    Remember to replace `eno1` with the proper Internet interface name.

2. Restart the network: 

    ```
    sudo systemctl restart networking
    ```

<Message type="tip">

The network interface is initialized with the command `allow-hotplug` by default on Debian 9. It is possible that the network restart fails with this configuration. In this case, you can initialize the network with `auto` to avoid the problem.

## How to configure IPv6 on Ubuntu

Ubuntu uses [netplan](https://netplan.io) as network configuration tool since the release of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. 
It replaces the classical network configuration with new configuration files, written in [YAML](https://yaml.org) format, and located in the `/etc/netplan` directory. For more information regarding netplan, refer to the official [netplan documentation](https://netplan.io/examples/).

1. Open the default configuration file `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml` in a text editor, and edit it as follows:

    ```yaml
    # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
    # For more information, see netplan(5).
    network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
        enp1s0:
        dhcp4: no
        dhcp6: no
        addresses:
        - "aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/24" # The main IP address of your Dedibox server
        - "<IPv6_FROM_YOUR_BLOCK>/64" # An IP address from your IPv6 block and it's subnet mask
        gateway4: aaa.bbb.ccc.1 # The gateway is the IP address of your Dedibox, ending on .1
        nameservers:
        addresses: [62.210.16.6, 62.210.16.7]
        routes:
        - to: 0.0.0.0
            via: aaa.bbb.ccc.1
            on-link: true
    ```

    Remember to replace `enp1s0` with the proper name of your Internet interface. 

    <Message type="note">

    The configuration example above is valid for the main IP address of your Dedibox server. If you want to use IPv6 on a [virtual machine](/dedibox-network/network/how-to/configure-network-netplan/#configuring-failover-ip-for-virtual-machines), remember to use the unique gateway for the failover IPv4.

    </Message>

2. Check and validate your configuration file.

    ```
    sudo netplan â€“debug
    ```

3. Activate the new configuration: 

    ```
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

## How to configure IPv6 on CentOS

1. Open the automatically generated configuration file for your Internet interface in a text editor, for example `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` and edit it as follows: 

    ```
    # Generated by parse-kickstart
    UUID=xxxxx
    DNS1=62.210.16.6
    BOOTPROTO=none
    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    TYPE=Ethernet
    IPADDR=62.210.xx.xx
    PREFIX=24
    GATEWAY=62.210.xx.1
    DEFROUTE=yes
    IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=no
    IPV6INIT=yes
    IPV6ADDR="IPV6ADDRESS/64" 
    IPV6_AUTOCONF=yes
    NAME="System eth0" 
    ```

2. Restart the networking service: 

    ```
    systemctl restart network.service
    ```
