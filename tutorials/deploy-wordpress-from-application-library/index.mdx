WordPress is a well-known CMS (content management system) allowing you to create evolving websites.

This tutorial teaches you how to install WordPress on a Scaleway [Kubernetes Kapsule](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/kubernetes/quickstart/) or Kosmos cluster by using the [Application Library in the Easy-Deploy feature](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/kubernetes/how-to/enable-easy-deploy/). 
You can achieve most of this directly from within the Scaleway Console. The steps of this tutorial are shown in the side menu on the right.

<Message type="requirement">

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [Kubernetes cluster](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) at Scaleway (Kapsule or Kosmos)
  - You have [kubectl](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/kubernetes/how-to/connect-cluster-kubectl) installed on your local computer

## Creating a Kubernetes Kapsule Cluster and deploying WordPress

1. Go to the [Kubernetes dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/kapsule/clusters) in the Scaleway console.
2. Select the cluster you want to deploy WordPress to.
3. Select the Easy Deploy tab.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-easy-deploy.webp" alt="" />

    The Application Library gives us the possibility to deploy a WordPress CMS application, which we can find by using the search bar on our Scaleway Console.

4. Click **Deploy an application**.
5. Select **Application Library** as application type.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-deploy-app.webp" alt="" />

6. Search for the application you want to deploy using the search bar.

    <Lightbox scr="scaleway-kubernetes-wordpress-app.webp" alt="" />

    By selecting it, the default configuration for the selected application will be set automatically in a [YAML](https://yaml.org) format.
    You can edit the configuration to fit to your application deployment within the YAML editor displayed.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-yaml-editor.webp" alt="" />

7. Enter a name for your application as well as a Kubernetes namespace to deploy it to.

    <Message type="important">

    If no namespace is chosen, your application will be deployed in your clusterâ€™s `default` namespace. Deploying in the `default` namespace is not a good practice and it is highly recommended to split your deployments, services, and application in separate namespace, thus allowing a more secure configuration of your cluster.

8. Once configured, click **Deploy an application** to deploy your application on your Kubernetes cluster.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-deploy-app-summary.webp" alt="" />

    You are then redirected to the listing page of our deployed applications.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-deployed-apps-list.webp" alt="" />

9. Check that the deployment is successful by running the command `kubectl get all -n cms-ns` in your terminal.

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-kubernetes-kubectl-all.webp" alt="" />

    You can see that your WordPress application is running, and even has created a mariadb database within your cluster to store our data on Scaleway Block Storage.
    You also have access to the Load Balancer that was created to access our WordPress using the external IP displayed.

10. Access your WordPress application by using this external IP in our web browser. The WordPress website displays in your browser.

    <Message type="note">

    * When wanting to update the configuration of our application, you may run into some errors returned by the API. Please read carefully these errors, as they contain the instructions you need to solve them.
    * When wanting to update your WordPress application configuration, you run into an error asking you to use the correct password to have the authorization to update the application.
      This is a security measure as the Application Library will automatically create the missing credentials that are not set at the deployment of the application and store them into secrets within your Kubernetes cluster.
      To retrieve these secret, you might need to run command lines such as the following:
      `$(kubectl get secret --namespace "cms-ns" wordpress-mariadb -o jsonpath="{.data.mariadb-password}" | base64 --decode)`
    All these instructions are given in the error message.
