Remote acces (KVM-over-IP) is an option available on most Elastic Metal servers. You can activate [remote access](/compute/elastic-metal/concepts/#remote-access) to install an OS of your choice using a remote ISO file.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)  
- You have [configured your SSH Key](/console/my-project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
- You have [created](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/create-server) an Elastic Metal server
- You have [activated](/compute/elastic-metal/concepts/#remote-access) remote access to the server.

</Message>

1. Click **Elastic Metal** in the **Compute** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The Elastic Metal dashboard displays.

2. Click on the link of your remote access interface. 

  <Message type="tip">

  If you have not activated the remote access option for your Elastic Metal server yet, follow our documentation [How to activate remote access](/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/activate-remote-access)

3. Open the connection URL displayed in a new browser window and log into the [BMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface#Baseboard_management_controller) of the server with the provided username and password.

5. Launch the remote console by double-clicking the downloaded file:

6. Click **Media** > **Virtual Media Wizard** to mount a local ISO file.

7. Choose the ISO file for the virtual CD ROM by clicking **Browse**. Then mount it by clicking **Connect CD/DVD**:

    <Lightbox src="assets/scaleway-kvm_connect_cd.webp" alt="" />

   Once the image file is connected, the following message displays:

    <Lightbox src="assets/scaleway-kvm_cd_connected.webp" alt="" />

8. Click **Power** > **Power Cycle Server** to reboot the server.

    <Lightbox src="assets/scaleway-kvm_power_cycle.webp" alt="" />

9. Press **F11** to enter the BIOS boot menu once the server has rebooted, and the logo of the manufacturer displays.

10. Select **AMI Virtual CDROM0 1.00** in the list of boot devices.

The server boots on the ISO image connected as virtual media. You can now continue with the installation of your Elastic Metal server using the setup tool of the OS.
